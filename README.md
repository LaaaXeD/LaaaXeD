Hello my name is Lamar I am 23 years old from Florida and am currently learning to code. 💻
I started a podcast called the Tangerine Podcast 🍊
I am using Free Code Camp, and the Odin Project to learn the basics of coding and putting them into practice. 
The languages I am learning are command line, HTML, CSS. Java Script i will be learning soon, along with a back-end language. 
My dream is to make a career in Software Develeopment and have my own startup one day. 👨‍💻
I understand there are no shortcuts in life I need to work hard and never stop learning. 🔑
